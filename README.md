# Automated-Data-Pipeline



End-to-end automated data pipeline, designed to collect weather data, transform it, and make it available for analysis and visualization. Built with a modern data stack, this project demonstrates a robust ETL, ELT workflow.

## 🚀 Project Overview



This pipeline automates the process of:



- **Extracting** real-time weather data from WeatherStack API.

- **Loading** raw data into a PostgreSQL database.

- **Transforming** raw data into clean, structured models using dbt.

- **Orchestrating** the entire workflow with Apache Airflow.

- **Visualizing** the transformed data using Apache Superset.



The entire stack is containerized using Docker Compose for easy setup and management on a Windows 11 machine with WSL.
